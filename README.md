JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

# UFO Level 1
<ul>
<li>Both pressing the "Filter Table" button and clicking "Enter" after inputting a date call the filterTable function and display the table of results.</li> 
<li>Clearing the input field and pressing "Enter" or the "Filter Table" button effectively clears the filter and displays all the data again.</li>
</ul>

# UFO Level 2
<ul>
<li>As one filter is applied e.g. a date, another can be added in the form of e.g. a country applied as a filter to the first set of data.  It is then possible to filter based on values in date, city, state, country and shape filters, or all five or any combination of these filters.</li>
<li>This also allows for filters to be used and displayed in the table and then add more filters to "drill down" more selectively into the data.  This would be useful for larger data sets especially.</li>
<li>Entering no search terms and just clicking the "Filter Table" button returns and displays all data in the set.</li>
<li>Clicking the "Reset Filters" button removes all filters that have been input and clears the displayed table of filtered data.</li>
</ul>
